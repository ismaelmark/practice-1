            <h3>Are You Feeling Like an Interloper Because You Don't Have a Business Plan?</h3>
            <p>Francesca De Meglio writes in BloombergBusiness on April 25, 2013, “Steve Blank pities those poor professors stuck teaching tired business plan courses. 'Business plan classes and business plan competitions are dead in the water for new ventures,' says Blank, who authored the cover story in the May 2013 issue of Harvard Business Review on the value of experimentation in building a new business. The premise of Blank’s course is that aspiring entrepreneurs need to know their customer and must test their hypotheses to have any chance at success."</p>
